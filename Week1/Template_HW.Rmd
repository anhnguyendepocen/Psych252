========================================
  
9.A.) 
-----------------------------------------
First, we calculated the mean of the non-normal distribution D0. 
  
```{r 9a_D0_mean}
x0=c(1:3,5,7,9); p0= c(.2,.4,.24,.10,.05,.01)
mu0=sum(x0*p0)/sum(p0)
print(mu0)
```
The mean of D0 is 2.66.

9.B.) 
-----------------------------------------
Next, we drew a sample of 1000 observations from the skewed distribution x0.
  
```{r 9b_x0_sample}
o1 = sample(x0, 1000, replace=T, prob = p0)
```

Then, we plotted a histogram of x0 was along with the estimated probability density function.

```{r 9b_histogram, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
rs1 = hist(o1, prob=T, main='Sampling distrn of x0, 1000 Samples'); lines(density(o1, adjust=3))
```
