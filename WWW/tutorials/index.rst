Logistic Regression
-------------------

This tutorial provides an introduction to logistic regression. Using an example
dataset from class, we walk through a ``glm()`` analysis, and discuss the
interpretation of results in terms of the data.

Math behind Chi Square tests
----------------------------

This PDF provides the math to run chi-square tests by hand. It includes both a
one-way classification (i.e., a goodness-of-fit test) and 2 way classification
(i.e., a contingency test, or test of independence).

Binomial Probability Theory
---------------------------

This tutorial walks through the basic probability theory of binomially
distributed random variables and shows how that theory can be levereged to
perform null hypothesis tests, estimation, prediction, and how it forms the
basis for logistic regression.
